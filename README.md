# AI-Driven-Roof-Damage-Analysis
An AI model predicting roof damage risk based on weather, roof age, and materials, enabling targeted inspections and efficient resource allocation.
# Roof Damage Analysis with Python and SQL

Welcome to the Roof Damage Analysis project! This project uses Python and SQL to simulate, analyze, and predict roof damage risks based on various factors like weather, roof age, and material type. The goal is to use AI and data visualization to derive actionable insights for prioritizing inspections and marketing efforts.

## Features

1. **Simulated Data**: Generates realistic data for roof damage analysis, including weather events, roof age, and material types.
2. **SQL Integration**: Stores and queries data using SQLite for efficient data handling.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
   - Visualizations to present insights clearly.
4. **AI Model**:
   - Trains a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict damage risk.
   - Provides feature importance for actionable recommendations.
5. **Action Plan**:
   - Derives insights for targeting high-risk regions and marketing efforts.

## How It Works

1. **Simulating Data**:
   - Creates a dataset with variables like wind speed, hail size, roof age, and material type.
   - Adds a "Damage Risk" column based on weather severity and roof condition.

2. **Storing Data**:
   - Saves the dataset in an SQLite database for easy querying and analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explores the dataset with statistical summaries and visualizations.
   - Highlights relationships between variables and damage risk.

4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict high-risk regions based on weather and roof features.
   - Evaluates the model's performance with metrics and a confusion matrix.

5. **Insights and Action Plan**:
   - Identifies key factors contributing to roof damage (e.g., wind speed, roof age).
   - Recommends targeting older roofs and regions with severe weather for inspections and marketing.

## Output Highlights

### Visualizations
- **Distribution of Wind Speeds**: Shows the range of wind speeds and their frequency.
- **Hail Size vs Roof Age**: Highlights the relationship between hail size, roof age, and damage risk.
- **Material Types and Damage Risk**: Displays which materials are most prone to damage.

### AI Model
- **Prediction**: Identifies high-risk regions for roof damage.
- **Feature Importance**: Highlights the most important factors affecting damage risk.

### Actionable Insights
- Prioritize inspections in regions with high wind speeds and large hail sizes.
- Focus marketing efforts on older roofs and areas prone to severe weather.
- Recommend durable materials like metal to reduce future risks.

## Customization
- Modify the simulation parameters (e.g., weather thresholds, material types) to suit your use case.
- Replace the simulated dataset with real-world data if available.
